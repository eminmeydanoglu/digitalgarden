Abductive logic: Abductive logic, also known as **abductive reasoning**, is a form of logical inference that starts with an observation and then seeks the simplest and most likely explanation for it. Unlike [[deductive reasoning]] , which guarantees the truth of its conclusion if the premises are true, or [[inductive reasoning]] (tümevarım), which generalizes from specific instances, abductive reasoning involves making an educated guess or hypothesis based on incomplete information.
