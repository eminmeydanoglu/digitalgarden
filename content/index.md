title: Hello, this is Emin.
---
Hello, I am Emin MeydanoÄŸlu, studying robotics engineering at [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/), and also passionate about physics, philosophy, and on how to live a good life.
This website consists of the pages I choose to share from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, which is literally my brain. 

Here are some of the main maps of content you can find on this brain: 
- [[Engineering]]: Technical notes and writings mainly on computer science, electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, engineering mathematics and physics.
- [[Philosophy]]: Writings, notes and personal thoughts on the big questions of life.
- [[Science]]: Interesting science topics that I learn. Very connected to [[philosophy]
- Wellbeing: Personal writings on how to live a good life, more from a philosophical point of view. (See [[Stoicism]])
