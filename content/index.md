Hello, I am Emin MeydanoÄŸlu. I am a Robotics Engineering student at [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/), and also passionate about physics, philosophy, and on how to live a good life.
This website consists of the pages I choose to share from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, which is literally my brain.
